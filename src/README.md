Hi, am King-Solomon by name a mobile application developer. Cute to say am a programmer by nature haha, well my love for visuals gave me a go ahead other into coding and mobile application development, the animation was something really captivating to me, i started as a website designer and also spent some few years as a designer before going into mobile development. With that experience i was comfortably growing as a developer, enjoying the hard times so as the good as i have experience something similair before, it was a long beautiful process but the plan was to make it through which i did by God's grace and right now creating apps visuals, making them intaractive and the processing of publishing it on the app store or google playstore is now a reality as i do that for my clients and guide them on how to monitor their apps and it's engagemment, but the fun fact is that am active to guide you through same process as it's the most important. So where do you say we start from? bringing your dream app to live? well slide into our Dm let's get started.
